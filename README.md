## 🚗 What is Zero 2.0?

ZERO is the next-generation decentralized car auction platform, built on blockchain and zero-knowledge technology. By incorporating zero-knowledge proofs (RISC Zero zkVM), the platform ensures secure execution across both off-chain and on-chain systems.

### The Problem ZERO Solves

Representing real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain is a major unsolved challenge. ZERO provides a way to verify and represent assets on-chain by proving off-chain executions, such as proof of state. The main problem we solve is ensuring security and trust in off-chain systems, leading to trusted execution and verification on-chain.

ZERO enables:

- **Private, verifiable car auctions**
- **On-chain representation of off-chain assets and actions**
- **Trustless proof of ownership, entry, and execution**
- **End-to-end privacy and data integrity**

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The system is composed of multiple core components, each playing a critical role in making the platform both efficient and secure:

```
/frontend   - NextJS frontend for user experience
/zk         - Zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) logic and proof generation
/contract   - Smart contracts for proof verification and asset minting
```

- **Frontend**: Seamless user experience for auctions and asset management
- **zkVM**: Cryptographic proof generation and off-chain execution verification
- **Smart Contracts**: On-chain proof verification, asset minting, and auction logic

## 🔑 Key Innovations & Components

- **ZK + CCIP Integration**: ZERO integrates zero-knowledge proofs and Chainlink CCIP for proof generation and state sync across multiple chains. The zkVM performs cryptographic operations off-chain, while on-chain verification ensures real-time trust and transparency.
- **Merkle Tree-Based Proofs**: All car data is hashed and validated using Merkle trees, guaranteeing that no data can be tampered with undetected. This validation occurs both on-chain and off-chain.
- **Privacy & Security**: Sensitive car data is always protected. Only relevant, non-sensitive data is exposed, while all other information remains private.
- **Proof Types**:
  - **Proof of State**: Verifies the current state of off-chain assets
  - **Proof of Entry**: Represents RWAs (cars) on the platform
  - **Proof of Ownership**: Verifies asset ownership
  - **Proof of Execution**: Verifies actions like bid, buy, sell, and auction

## 🛠️ Challenges & Solutions

- **State Verification**: Ensuring the off-chain database state matches the on-chain proof. ZERO uses zkVM to prove the execution of state checks, returning a verifiable status that anyone can independently verify.
- **Cross-Chain Sync & Replay Protection**: Cross-chain applications and NFTs must sync system state to prevent replay attacks. By leveraging CCIP and Chainlink Functions, our contracts can access off-chain state via custom API endpoints, which run zkVM state checks and return IPFS hashes of the data.

## 🧩 Proof of State & Asset Integrity

ZERO enables:

- **Proof of State**: Verifying the current state of an asset or auction
- **Proof of Entry**: Onboarding and representing a car as an RWA
- **Proof of Ownership**: Proving who owns what, without revealing sensitive details
- **Proof of Execution**: Verifying actions (bid, buy, sell) occurred as claimed

All proofs are cryptographically verifiable, ensuring transparency, privacy, and trust.

## 🏁 Conclusion

ZERO is not just a car auction platform—it's a transformative leap forward in how real-world assets are represented and traded in a decentralized world. By using zero-knowledge proofs, the platform ensures that each auction is transparent, verifiable, and secure, while maintaining privacy for all parties involved. With a user-friendly frontend, advanced backend architecture, and a strong commitment to security, ZERO 2.0 is poised to become the go-to solution for blockchain-based car auctions.

# Database Seeder

This directory contains the database seeder for the Car Auction Platform. The seeder populates the database with sample data including cars, auctions, bids, comments, and saved auctions.

## Files

- `seed.sql` - Raw SQL script for seeding the database
- `src/seeder.rs` - Rust-based seeder with programmatic data insertion
- `src/main.rs` - CLI interface to run the seeder

## Usage

### Option 1: Using the Rust Seeder (Recommended)

1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/car_auction"
   ```

2. Run the seeder:
   ```bash
   cd db
   cargo run
   ```

### Option 2: Using the SQL Script

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
2. Run the SQL script:
   ```bash
   psql -d car_auction -f seed.sql
   ```

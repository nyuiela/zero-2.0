## Euler Protocol implementation On ZERO Plan and structure

## structure

a smart contract that executes flash loan arbitrage to help users reach a target amount of tokens (WETH or USDC) for auction bidding

additional feature -- when brands stake -- funds will be deposited into yield vaults to generate yield

// Example: WETH → USDC → WETH arbitrage

1. Borrow WETH from vault
2. Swap WETH → USDC (using Euler Swap)
3. Swap USDC → WETH (using Euler Swap)
4. Repay WETH to vault
5. Keep profit in target token

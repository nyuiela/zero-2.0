### Zero Smart contract Notes and planning
***author** Lydia

## Permission
- function selector wise persion calls
- modifiers/ function as modiers; csn calls
- onwer roles and constants/ addresses

## Oracle
- oracle house
- oracle factory -- made this a clonable from the registration
- Dev remember to update the registraction logic to go with the zk implemations !!!!

## master manage
- implements logic for listers
- hold oracle cloning and persion 

## how they coonet
- all zk verified listers will be cloned a manger address that links with the permssion address and oracle implemntation to fetch price feed of their asset from the oraclemaster


## Next Step

- Auctiion -- the car owner are going to auction, owner can be buyers who have full ownership
buy ---- new owner --- aution 

- transfer ownership for car logic ---- ownship contract -- ownership rights 
  
- Transfer contract...... instead of hiting transfer i will make a whole contract for that
// use ETH and usdc?? right? okay cool
  
- car_registry -- goes with the registercar in orcale --- match it and change to fit zk -- qualifications needed

-- CCIP ------

## more 
-- state change ?? -- meaning??
-- buy(list) / sell
-- steps 

check proofs/ merkle_verifier  
after the events happen, sync /update ?? the state --- verify the changes accros all chains
interworks with the ccip


/// transfer....
